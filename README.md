## Progress Made for Milestone:
So far we have set up the first 3-4 view controllers of our application. Our main focus for this milestone was to get the login and sign up features of the application working with Firebase. We ran into the issue where our sign up/create user works on firebase but only from one computer and not from the other. When we both pull the same exact code from github, the firebase create user feature only works on Anna's computer's simulator and anu devices connected to her computer while running the code and not Justine's. We are working on figuring out why that may be the case and thought that it was important to include in our READ.ME. We also have the issue where our GoogleService-Info.plist file is not transferring when git pulled from github even though we have the file in our master branch. If you run into that issue while running our code, follow this project path and you should be able to find the file and transfer it into Xcode manually so that the program runs: final-project-final-ios-wuwen/final_project_mobile_wuwen/GoogleService-Info.plist. In the sign up process for our application we also added in the email verification feature where the user is sent a verfication link to verify that they are a UVA student. We also worked on implementing and finalizing the camera feature so that the user can save a profile picture to their account. 

If you have any issues running our code or understanding the information that we provided above, please reach out to either one of us so that we can physically show you what we mean. Thanks!

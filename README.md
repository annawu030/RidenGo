## Progress Made for Milestone:
So far we have set up the first 3-4 view controllers of our application. Our main focus for this milestone was to get the login and 
sign up features of the application working with Firebase. We also worked on implementing the camera feature so that the 
user can save a profile picture to their account. 

Main Feature: At least 3 "screens" <br/>
Optional Feature #1: Camera <br/>
Optional Feature #2: Log in and Sign up using Firebase <br/>
